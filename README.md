**Problem Statement**  
Traditional methods of hiding data in images, such as Least Significant Bit (LSB) modification, are prone to detection and data corruption. This project proposes a **secure and simple method** for embedding secret messages into images using pixel manipulation, ensuring basic encryption with a passcode-based authentication system.  

---  

## **Technology Used**  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, os, string  
- **Platform:** Google Colab / Local Machine

## **Wow Factors**  
‚úÖ Simple yet effective approach to **image-based data hiding**  
‚úÖ Uses **passcode protection** to prevent unauthorized access  
‚úÖ Works with standard **JPEG image formats**  
‚úÖ Lightweight and easy to implement in real-world applications

## **End Users**  
- **Cybersecurity Enthusiasts**: Learning about steganography  
- **Forensic Analysts**: Extracting hidden messages in images  
- **Journalists & Whistleblowers**: Secure communication  
- **Students & Researchers**: Studying image security methods

## **Results**  
### **Step 1: Cover Image**  
- The original image used to embed the secret message  
### **Step 2: Encrypted Image**  
- The modified image that contains the hidden data  
### **Step 3: Decrypted Message**  
- Successfully extracted secret message upon entering the correct passcode
